# biogrowth4

The *biogrowth4* web-app provides advance functionality for modelling the growth of populations using methods from predictive microbiology. This includes:
- Making predictions under constant environmental conditions (primary models)
- Making predictions under dynamic environmental conditions (primary models + an arbitrary number of secondary models)
- Making predictions including parameter uncertainty
- Fitting primary growth models
- Fitting secondary models
- Fitting a gamma model combining various secondary models
- Fitting primary and secondary growth models to data obtained under dynamic conditions
- Fitting primary and secondary growth models to data obtained under experiments with different conditions (global fitting)
- Estimation of the growth rate using the serial dilution method

All these calculations can be done using various models from predictive microbiology (Baranyi, modified Gompertz, Logistic, Ratkowsky, Cardinal...).
